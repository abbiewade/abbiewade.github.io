# COMP3100 Learning Portfolio - Robocup@Home

Robocup@Home is a competition which aims to develop service and assistive robot technology with high relevance for future personal and domestic applications. It is the largest international competition of this kind, and is part of the RoboCup initiative. A set of benchmark tests is used to evaluate the robots' abilities and performance in a realistic home environment. Focus lies on the following domains but is not limited to: Human-Robot-Interaction and Cooperation, Navigation and Mapping in dynamic environments, Computer Vision, Object Manipulation, Ambient Intelligence and System Integration. The tasks are open-ended, with many viable avenues to research. For more detail about the competition, see the competition website here - http://www.robocupathome.org/.


## Week 1 + 2 (SEM 1 WK 1, WK 2)
The first two weeks of this course have felt slow. In a sense I think I should have been in a project and already started by the end of week 1. It definitely would have been more convenient to have had the course start in o-week which would have started us two weeks early. Never-the-less at the end of the second week we now have a team (which I think? is set in stone) and a project to work on. I there is a separate page you can find here if you want to know more information about the team formation day.

### Robocup@Home so far...

Due to the fact that this project was proposed by me, there has been a lot of work that I have put into it to get it off the ground. I figure here would be a good place to really talk about what I have done to get to where we are so far so I am ready for a meeting next week to pass over to Jess and Greg (the project team leaders).

This project will have a lot of breadth in terms of people working on it. So far there is a bunch of 1st and 2nd years who want to work as part of the team, all which have a robotic background. I have been in contact with Liam Waldron about an engineering team working on this project in the course he is a convener for. The agreement has been reached that ENGN4221 will have a team working on this project that will begin in semester two. On top of this, there is the team that will be added in for this course. As for mentors, Gerard Ellias and Phil Wade, Australian Robocup International Representatives, have offered to be mentors. Both have a very strong robotics background, however they do not work in the fields required for the programming side of things.

I have contacted the dean about sponsoring the project, and a meeting has been set up for week 5. We will also need to think about further sponsorship and a website for the project. Other than this, I have broken down the problem of Robocup in a minor amount of detail - such as what parts we need to consider for each of the three main programming challenges (vision, speech and mapping).

### Introduction Lecture

I don't think there is much more to mention about this because the real purpose of this lecture seemed to be to get everyone up to speed on the course. I think it left a few questions unanswered for me, mostly because I think my project has a few different exceptions to normal, but otherwise it was a really useful lecture to have. It may have been worth having the team formation day directly after this lecture (or on this night) because it would have given us a whole heap of extra two weeks to work on our project. There might have been more attendance as well because it would have been on a weekday rather than a week night.

### Innovations ACT

To be honest, I found this lecture less useful that I was hoping and I found it very hard to stay engaged during it. I honestly feel that this lecture was more of a pitch session for innovations ACT rather than helping us get started with an innovations project. I feel that this lecture would have been way more useful if it took the road of how to start-up something big, with what innovations ACT has to offer as a subpart under resources available to your disposal. It would have been more useful if we knew places we needed to go to get information like legality, starting up company and/or business, money handling, etc..

### Useful Tutorial Hints

In our first tutorial we were given some useful hints for the learning portfolio. I want to mention them here so I have them as reference.

  - Why are we being told that?
  - What is the big picture?
  - Why did I do that?
  - Ask Why and answer with supporting evidence.

Additionally, we were given more information about what is expected from us in the first project review. I figure it is worthwhile writing this down as reference as well, especially because we are going to want to be able to flick back through our portfolios and be able to get answers and evidence from this for the review.

  - Do you really understand the problem you are trying to solve?
  - Do you understand why you are doing what you are doing?
  - Have evidence for your decisions (e.g. research) and of the work you have done.
  - How did you figure out the requirements?
  - Are you getting stuck in the project?

It was also mentioned that the second project review what about what has changed since last time and what has been done so far. The final project review would be about the end product.

## Team Formation day

I was only able to attend half this event unfortunately due to prior commitments so I don't have a lot to write about. The extent of why participation was the discussion with different people about the questions below, and the formation of a team by pitching to people and selling what a fun project it is going to be. I have answered the questions from the first half of the day in a little more detail than I had when thinking on the spot.

### What do I want to get out of Techlauncher?

There are three different aspects to this question that need to be reflected upon: today, the course, and my degree. For the today, I didn't have many more expectations that to form a team and get the project I was to propose off the ground. I was determined to make my project start up - and my expectations were met. I was hoping to find an appropriate mentor, but I don't think I was at the event long enough for this to happen. As for techlauncher, I have probably too many expectations. There has been a lot of work already put into the project behind the scenes in building up people and this has definitely influenced my expectations. I want experience working with a large group of people on a common project - and these people to be in different fields. I want to gain more programming in teams skills. While I have done group projects where we shared common code, I feel this project is going to be on a much higher scale and require more coordination and communication when working on common repositories. I want to learn more about computer vision than I already know (which I know isn't enough yet). To be honest, most of all I want to create a Robocup@Home team that is passed down through undergraduates so we get the opportunity to research, be part of the wider international community and do more than simple coding projects. Expectations for my degree is a very hard question for me to answer. I hope to get a job at some point, but to do this I need to decide on what type of job I want. I talk about not wanting to major, but maybe this is just because I haven't found the 'spark' of computer science I want to follow as a career. I guess because I am unsure about if ICT is what I want to make a career of, my expectations are fuzzy. I want a sound understanding of computer science, and I want to be inspired.

### What roles do I want to have?

I want to be a programmer and tester in this project. I want to jump in and get my hands dirty. I have already been doing a lot of the leading and decisions in building the team and project up from an idea and I am now really happy it is being handed over to 4th years to lead.

### What do I want to have achieved by the end of year?

I want this project and team to become something that is passed down through different undergraduates and is known for how much fun it is. Don't get me wrong - I know that this will be a tough project. I have no delusions of that - I also know from previous experience that the amount you put in is the amount you get out with projects like this. I want to get more skills in group projects of this size and work on developing a project this size from scratch. I want to be traveling to Germany next year to compete where we can meet so many different people, participants and otherwise; where we can actually show off what we have achieved, and where we can learn from other participants things that hadn't even crossed our mind.

## Week 3 (SEM 1 WK 3)

Unfortunately due to availabilities of everyone, the first team meeting we can set is on Friday of Week 4. Until then, the most I can really do is brief the project managers and get everything ready and set up for the upcoming weeks. Thus, this weeks reflections will not be as detailed or as long as I expect weeks to come will be.

### Problem Identification Lecture

Holy cow this was a great lecture. I really couldn't believe how obvious the answers were when we were asked what innovation is. It seems to be this hyped up term that really doesn't actually explain what innovation is. Both students and lecturers were all saying things like new, improved, progress, creative, etc.. What we all failed to mention was that innovation is an implementation of a problem that we are trying to solve in the context of the problem. It seems so obvious now, but it was really interesting to see the stereotype the word innovation has developed. I guess I have always thought of myself as an innovative thinker, and this probably comes down to I was never taught differently.

I view both of my parents were innovators and entrepreneurs who have built up multiple successful companies and businesses. I remember nights when I was a kid sleeping with my sister underneath the office table while they worked towards whatever it was they were doing. As many people have pointed out to me, both my sister and I are an expectation to a lot of different stereotypes (such as women in STEM) because we were exposed to things not normally exposed to in homes. I guess this triggered me to go and talk to my parents about what it actually means to be innovators, and this turned out to be quite an interesting conversation. One thing that they said which hadn't occurred to me what that innovators never take no for an answer.

The idea of barriers just doesn't exist - you don't give up just because one little thing stops you. I think this nicely pairs up with the idea that innovators accept failure and keep going - it doesn't stop them. Failure doesn't become a barrier for them. One thing that I definitely agree with is that not everyone can be an innovator. I think that saying that everyone can innovate is like saying that everyone can do art. Technically yes, everyone can do art, but not well or at the level of an expert. With Art there is also an element of raw talent. I believe this to be the same as innovation - some people have the raw talent to be innovators, and with help they become innovators.

One thing that surprised me was my mum doesn't think of herself as an innovator the way I see it. She seemed to think that people can be really good at the innovative planning and making the idea happen, but these people don't have the same innovative ideas that start the ball rolling. When you pair these type of people up with an innovator its deadly, but to society they appear to be an innovator, when really they are more of the assistant. I wonder if this is actually the case, or if these type of people could be considered innovators as well. The term artist is very widely used and represents many different levels of capabilities of expert artists. Just because you are an artist doesn't mean you have to paint and sculpt. Maybe there are different types of innovators and different levels which are still considered innovators.

The other large point that was brought up in the lecture was that as a developer and innovator you need to recognize the holistic manner of the needs - the big picture, the whole system. This pretty closely links back to the systems thinking idea from COMP3530 (in fact I think it compliments it quite nicely) but it was nice to hear about how you really need to put the users needs first. If you are designing something for a preschool kid, you need to look at their daily challenges as their challenges will be a whole different set to that of an elderly person for instance. You need to actually design a solution, not give a solution to fit a need which the user doesn't have.

This idea of solution design fits really nicely into the RC@H project because we have to design a system that will work and actually solve the problem. it is no use to us if we can identify an object but cant actually recognize there is an object in the field we are looking. It is no use to us if we know via speech recognition that we need to go get milk from the fridge if we don't even know where the fridge is. There are so many dependencies in this project that we need to really plan and take a systems approach to solving the problem than the solution that we want to design.

### Meeting with Project Managers

Chris and I met up with Jess and Greg this week to fill them in on everything we had in our heads. This was really important because if they are leading the project they need to know everything we have done, reasons we have done it and where we were planning to go next so that there is a smooth transition of project leaders. A lot of the stuff that was said was what I mentioned in the previous weeks reflections. There were some really useful things to get out of this as well - such as the idea of going to China's competition regardless of us competing to find a mentor and to get knowledge of the competition, and the idea about giving the website as a project to another group project for the college. There seemed like there was a lot of thought about how to handle this project and both seem really enthusiastic. I cant wait to get started.

## Week 4 (SEM 1 WK 4)

This week seems like a bit of a doosy week for the course for me. There is honestly next to nothing to talk about or really reflect on. Hopefully this changes in weeks to come.

### Reflective Writing (lecture)

This lecture was interesting, but I didn't get as much out of it as I hoped. All this lecture really did for me was cement things I already knew, which I guess was a benefit. It was nice to see examples of poor learning portfolios, but even then - not amazingly useful. Hopefully there wasn't something I overlooked or missed in this lecture. Maybe my lack of enthusiasm for this lecture comes from my lack of enthusiasm about writing reflective pieces. Three of the compulsory COMP courses have elements of reflective writing. You get a bit sick of it after a while (particularly when it is a requirement for PAL as well)> Maybe it would be nice if we could combine some of the reflective pieces for students taking a combination of the courses. They are all interlinked so maybe this could be a very good way to find and display connections between all the courses.

### The Project so Far

We didn't get to meet up as a team until Friday of this week. It feels as though we have jumped off to a really late start, and worse off - nearly every team member except for the project managers left that meeting with nothing to do. I was assigned nothing really important this week. I feel a bit stuck in the project with nothing to do because there is only so much you can set yourself to do. It becomes a bit impossible to meet the course requirements which I think is highly problematic. The only thing I can hope for is in later weeks that we can make up this time elsewhere and it evens out.

The one thing that I could set myself to do this week was preparation for the meeting with the dean which is set to be next week. A lot of this preparation was rereading rules, estimating budget and generally getting ready for the meeting. It seems like this project might be a little easier with regards to requirements because we have a strict set of competition rules which we need to adhere to. I will report back next week with how this meeting went.

## Week 5 (SEM 1 WK 5)

This week involves a meeting with the dean with next to no genuine work on the project.

### Meeting with the CECS Dean

This meeting I think was a good and a bad step in the right direction. I guess the bad step is the easiest part of talk about - the amount of paperwork that needs to be done has increased ten-fold. It means getting the project actually started might be even more of a challenge. The good stuff that came out of it was that the dean didn't say no to anything. Instead she gave us a whole heap of stuff to go away and do to make the project something that people are more likely to back. She talked about patrons, advisory boards, sponsorship lists, and financial setups amongst other things like pitching the idea. She wants us to go and get the sub-deans of the college to back the idea (which has been set up for week 8). I think we sold the idea well, and did everything right, we just have a lot to go away and achieve before we can get people to back the idea.

To be honest, I don't understand all the different terms that have been given to things we need to achieve leaving this meeting. I don't quite see why some of the things that are useful. I really like the idea of setting up goal-based sponsorship. But basically I am happy to leave these tasks which have been taken away to the PMs. I just want to jump into this project as soon as I can. And yet the most important thing I took out of the meeting with the dean was the measure of this project as successful. The project isn't successful for us if we get a working project. The project is successful for us if the team is still running and competing in a decade time. We are starting the legacy, not trying to win a competition.

### The Project So Far

This week was yet another week where we sat around and twiddled our thumbs (apart from the stuff I have been involved with above). In our meeting on Friday, our PMs came back and assigned us to different tasks with the instruction of researching and getting an understanding. I got assigned to two things - architecture of the system, and helping out the PMs. I feel quite daunted by the architecture challenge ahead, since honestly I have no experience of any kind on my side. The only think I have which will help is a mentor who knows what they are doing. As for helping out with the project management stuff, this came back to stakeholder documents which need to be done up. To be perfectly honest, I was really hoping to leave the project management stuff behind because it is something that I really don't enjoy. Lets hope it doesn't last too long. I guess the good outcome of this week is that we now have stuff to do. I can now actually have stuff to talk about, which is excellent.

## Week 6 (SEM 1 WK 6)

I know that it is not required to talk about the lecture, but I honestly think that it has been worthwhile most weeks talking about the take-home parts of the lecture and how it links back to everything. Other than that, this week has been a lot of reading with no decisions made. There isn't amazing parts to talk about or really show for time spent but I am feeling a little more confident in starting parts of the architecture and what I am actually aiming to do.

### From Idea to Launch: building early stage software products (lecture)

The most interesting idea that came out of this lecture this week is that money does not define if a start-up is successful or not. The way a start up is defined as successful is how it solves the problem and whether it actually does what you set out to do (based on the requirements). A project which is being started up needs to meet requirements, both in terms of what the project needs to achieve, but also in terms of what the market needs of the project. A lot of people want to build ideas because they have come up with it, but not all of these ideas are on demand from the population and are not a successful start up.

### Stakeholders Document

One of the requirements for this part was that one of the PMs wanted to set up a meeting to do this. The meeting didn't happen this week, so while I was assigned to this, and had done minor preparation for it, nothing was followed through. One thing though that did occur to me is I have no idea what the best way to document this is. What information do you actually need to write down in the stakeholder list? I have passed on some of these questions to the PM and it has been decided that we will meet at a later date.

### Architecture in General

When I left the meeting last week asking me to do architecture, the PM asked me to do a SAD and SDD for the project. I think at the time the PM didn't realize how big the task they set me was. After researching the documents on the Internet, with not really much success, I got in contact with my mentor and that was where I found out that for this type of project a HLDD and LLDD was probably more relevant. He sent me away with a list of diagrams to look up and start to think about. I think one thing at the end of this week that I really need to think about in a few weeks is design patterns that we want to use. I know that we are talking about a rules engine controlling the robot (which is similar to an expert system) but that means I really need to understand the interactions before starting to do the final designs of the system. I have a feeling this is why my mentor is getting me to start with the HLDD.

### The Project in General

The project seems a little more on track this week. Everyone went away with something to do. I have reported up above what I have been up to in the past week. There was a minor argument which came up in the meeting on Friday this week about what is the difference between advisory board members, mentors and SMEs (which was a new term introduced due to the argument). I feel this was actually a really important discussion which had to happen, but I also feel that I am the only person in the group that thinks this. Most people think it was just a semantics argument. I think that given the structure and documents we have to set up, it is important to know classification so people are on the same page. I keep talking about my mentor who is helping with architecture - but in fact I think he is actually classified under the new way as an SME. Personally I think of him as more of a mentor though. It was decided that an SME was someone we could go to to get answers, and a mentor would help direct people toward resources and help out. My mentor does this for me, but I think he would not be as useful to other people. Then again, maybe the project actually needs a mentor for architecture as well as computer vision, robotics and speech processing. It seems to be a bit of a touchy subject at the moment so the best way forward seems to be to leave it.

## Week 7 (SEM 1 WK 7)

This week I feel has gone way better than previous weeks. This week I have actually had goals to work towards. I made a fairly conscious decision to leave behind some of the work that was assigned to me and to just work on architecture. And as you will see below in a lot more detail, this was probably a wise choice. I didn't realize going into the week how much work and time it takes to design a system. I was worried about not doing enough in the past few weeks, but I am fairly happy to say that now I have made that up. I have included some examples on another page which is linked below, but to be perfectly honest - there were so many different designs and iterations.

### Design in Difficult Places - The Story of a Start-Up (Lecture)

I really liked how this lecture covered that failure is not the be all and end all of a project. I think failure is a really important part of life, particularly projects that you are working on. Nothing ever goes right first time around, and the skill where you accept failure and still move forward is definitely an important one. I think in the case of our project, I really hope we wont see it fail as a whole, but I am already predicting that there will be small failures in different modules as we develop and test different functionalities. The important part is working around the failures to find a new solution, which I really hope this team can do.

### Architecture: Contextual Diagrams

This week has been all about generating a draft (or close to draft) version of the contextual diagram for a system. What I have come to realize how complex and difficult that architecture of a complex system is, and how terrible the Internet resources are out there for a beginner. Last week I was told by the person who is helping me with what I need to do when designing a system was to develop a High Level Design Document, so I went away and researched. Yet when I talked to him again at the beginning of this week, after all the research I tried to do last week, I was so unprepared for when he told me this diagram type was where I needed to start. I hadn't come across it so he sat down and started drawing basic pictures of what I need to make it look like, and what I needed to document in a separate document around it. I think I eventually want to make something like a tutorial around designing a HLDD, so I have separated more information about how I define and developed Contextual Diagrams then click the link back there to check it out.

While I know that many systems will be consistently refines, I didn't realize it started so early. There are a few pictures that are included on the Contextual Diagrams page. When going through the process, it surprised me how different my first version of my the diagram turned out compared to what I expected it to. I guess at the start of this week, despite all the work that I had done last week, I really didn't understand the problem that I was trying to solve. I was still looking at what a high level document was rather than how to break it down. I think that is what my mentor has helped me with the most. He has helped me realize that solving the architecture problem of this system is something that I can do step by step, and the first step is trying to understand the context of the system.

### Study-Break

It seems fairly obvious that I need to do a lot of work over the study break to get the architecture a lot more of the way through. I feel a lot of pressure from my team and project managers that I need to get the whole system designed because I am holding everyone back. thus this is where a lot of my time needs to be spent in the holidays.

## Week 8 (SEM 1 WK 8)
This week has been a lot of work for me - particularly because of the mid-semester holidays. I became quite stressed over these holidays because while I feel I am now pretty well an expert of the requirements for this project and how to draw conceptual and contextual diagrams, there were design decisions which I screwed up and I felt like I didn't have enough support from any of the team to go further. Week 8 had a lot of time spent with my mentor getting through some of these issues and how to deal with them, in meetings or getting ready for meetings and cleaning up the diagrams for the broken system.

### Directors Meeting

This meeting was highly successful. Chris, Greg and I met with Alistair and Rob, the directors of Computer Science and Engineering respectfully. One thing that meeting with Eleanor required was for us to seek the college director’s approval for the project. After selling the project spiel, there was discussions on where we see the project developing and the future. Some really useful feedback did come out of this meeting though - three of them being:

  - We need to treat this project as a systems project, where we do everything as simple as possible, and only do ONE thing differently for the purposes of research.
  - We need to formalize the Engineering side of the project further.
  - We need to introduce academic champions to the project for a better focus.

While a lot of the things to take away from this meeting was mostly for the PMs to work on, it is good idea to keep it in mind. A lot of the work for the PMs this year seems to be setting up the project for the future. And this is a huge job. One of the biggest project goals this year was to set it up for the future - so working towards academic supervisors and setting up the engineering team will be very worthwhile and fit into the project goals quite fitting.

### High Level Architecture, Mid-Semester Break and Team Frustrations

I spent a lot of time over the previous few weeks working on the conceptual diagrams and naively beginning sequential diagrams for this system. The thing is, no matter how much work I did, it was honestly a waste of time. Frankly it was a beyond stupid move to ask one inexperienced student who had never done anything like this to design a system so complex. While I have learnt a lot, it came to mid this week when I checked in with my mentor where a critical error was pointed out in my design meaning that everything had to be scrapped and started again. It was a simple error of how often the visual component was called, or if it ran autonomously and sent interrupts to the control center, but definitely big enough that we had to start again. I am sure that nearly everyone who is marking has seen this video before, but it feels very relevant to how I am feeling.

http://youtu.be/BKorP55Aqvg

In the group at the moment I feel like Anderson from the beginning. Just like Anderson being asked to draw 7 red lines, some with transparent ink, I feel I am in the situation where I am being asked to do something impossible - design a system that I don't have a complete understanding about, and the time frame pressures are too much for a complete beginner. Additionally, when I ask for help or try and voice concerns in a polite way, it seems like the situation with Anderson demonstrating perpendicularity. The lady in white couldn't even answer if the two lines were perpendicular, she had to have Anderson tell her that they were. She then went to draw a triangle saying that it was perpendicular. I feel that regardless of what I say or how I mention I need help it is ignored. I introduced the idea of sequential diagrams to the team and asked that each person choose a use story that related to what they have been working on so that I can get an idea of their expectations of the module and system. Long behold, when we came to the meeting directly after the break no one had done this, and further more the PMs just ticked off what it was and decided that it wasn’t important if it didn’t get done. It has made me realize just how frustrating and difficult it can be working on a project where not everyone has the expertise required to do the job they set out to do. It is frustrating and does require a whole different skill set to deal with. And while I know that everyone is learning and experiencing the same frustration in the project, this was the first time that I really felt it. And I felt helpless about it which wasn't a great experience. I feel the last line of the short is so relevant - "of course I can. I can do anything. I can do absolutely anything. I’m an expert."

### The Teams Holidays

I think my team was quite busy in the holidays. The PMs seemed to do a lot of work in preparation for the Directors meeting this week. The preparation they did had a positive impact on the outcome of the meeting so that was very successful. I think Cameron and Chris spent a lot of time reading up about how to implement speech. In hindsight, we all looked at this part of the challenge as easy, but didn't stop to evaluate that when factoring in language difficulties it is a harder task than it initially seems. Seb and Magic managed seemed to go quite far in initial implementations of object tracking and Eigen faces respectfully. I don't think it was completely purposeful for Seb and Magic to go down different paths, but I think it is working really well and should be implemented in further years.

### Technical Workshop

After talking to my mentor this week, particularly about my frustrations about designing this system, with the team interactions about the system design, and not knowing how to make some of the important design decisions I called a technical workshop for the Saturday night of this week. There were three reasons my mentor and I decided that this was the best way forward:

  - To show everyone where I am up to with the design of th system
  - To collaborate on a number of issues with the current design of the system
  - To bring everyone’s knowledge together to work through the issues of the current design

Basically I wanted to have a direction for the design and know the use cases, how the use cases map into the design and where to take the next steps for the high level design. Additionally, my mentor agreed to help guide us through the night to get help get as far through as we could.

The night was a huge success. It started off by catching everyone up with the work that I did over the holidays. Personally it seemed as though none of the team members who came to this night had actually seen what I had been working on at all. I think I surprised them all with the knowledge of the system and all the work I had put into the 10 or so diagrams I had printed off. All the work I had done up till this Saturday night was then put aside and as a group we started listing out all the capabilities that our robot is required to have under the different modules that we thought we would need. By doing this, and by using everyone’s expertise we were able to work out how we all viewed the different modules to interact and come to an agreement. This took nearly three hours but it was well and truly worth it. We then started to list out the most basic use cases that the system would need and draw simplistic sequential diagrams which were used to translate everyone’s expectations of the system. This of course meant that we kept on revisiting the capabilities list we developed throughout the night.

The night ended with two lists for the team to work through - one for the team:

  - review requirements table (ST)
  - find someone to do the mapping (LT)
  - work out use cases and priorities them (ST)
  - draw sequence diagrams for use cases (ST)

and one for me to complete:

  - Redevelop the Contextual and Conceptual Diagrams
  - List out the majority of the use cases of the system
  - Construct sequence diagrams for the use cases identified
  - Develop the prerequisites for the sequence diagrams
  - List out the alternatives of the sequence diagrams

All things considered, none of these lists will have been completed this week because of the late nature of the technical meeting.

This night really helped me get back on track. I was able to develop the same view as the team for the way we all envisioned this system. I gained a lot of confidence on my knowledge of the system and how it was to work. I gained direction for where I next needed to head. I think the team managed to gain the same direction and vision of the system we are building together. I think the most important thing that we all learnt though was that technical meetings are important. We need meetings for problems on the technical side of the project, led by the technical team people rather than the PMs.

To be honest, looking back on this night, it was one of the most important choices my mentor helped me make on this project so far. I have learnt how to appropriately take a situation in a project that I am having what I consider to be major issues with, and to resolve these issues in a way that makes everyone happy. This idea of a technical meeting had not even occurred to me, especially since I was so worried about all the rules, constraints and documentation that the project had in place. In hindsight, it was the best outcome expected, and I am really thankful for learning about how to deal with these types of not so fun problems.

## Week 9 (SEM 1 WK 9)

### System Architecture

One thing I realized starting this week was that I really have my work cut out for me. I think initially when I was assigned the job of system architecture, we all assumed it would be a minor job that wouldn't take very long. I can now clearly see that for a system this complex, and for someone with next to no experience, this is definitely not the case. I have been given a few high level architecture documents to look over from my mentor and most of them average on 50 pages. I guess I have finally accepted that the rest of my year on this project I will basically be trying to develop a baseline of the high level architecture of how we envision this system so the team next year can take it on.

I have probably spent way too long on the project this week, averaging on close to double what is expected of us. Personally, I have taken everything that came out of the first technical workshop and started to fix it all up so that there was something to show in the Project Interview. The outcomes of the technical workshop can be found the the previous weeks reflections, but basically I have focused on redesigning the contextual and conceptual diagrams, as well as starting to list out the use cases. I have spent some time reviewing the requirements table and reflecting over the rules to work out what I personally think we should prioritize for the different competitions. This was all shown in the project interview, and seem to be well received.

### Project Interview \#1

The project review seemed to be a big success. I was pretty unsure of how it was going to run going into the meeting, even with the power-point that Jess and Greg completed. It ran a lot more smoothly than expected. There had been no practice run through with the entire team before this interview, something that I now see should have happened. I think being about to give feedback about the presentation to the PMs and for them to give feedback to us would have helped with the teams presentation. We were obviously all aiming for a good mark in this project review so it would have been useful to give feedback. I felt a little bad for some of the other team mates, as while I know that they have been working towards a lot of things and doing a hell of a lot of background research which was required, it didn't show through as easily as the things I did.



So a few things for the next project interview that I want to remember:

  - Do a practice run through where open feedback is given to all members.
  - Make sure that every member has something physical to show at the interview.
  - Ask all team members to review their learning portfolio before entering into the interview so they have a fresh idea in their heads of what has been achieved since the previous project interview.

### Writing Code as a Team and Style Guides

XKCD, Code Quality

This image really came to mind when I was relaxing after the meeting this week. There was discussion how everyone should start coding and uploading it to gitlab with a file on how to use the code and install any dependencies. This triggered me to ask about style guides and if we could choose a particular way to all follow. Now, when doing a Google search for "Project Style Guides" not only were there 92,800,000 results, but there were many already done style guides for different languages. I honestly felt that we could have found and decided on one within 10 minutes as a team. Especially since the first link to Google's Style Guides are highly defined and based on language. We could easily have followed these till we came up with a method for our own. For now we were told to go away and follow our own style until the PMs came up with something. I feel that this wasn't the ideal solution because now the technical team who are actually building the project have no input into it. Although maybe next week rather than giving it to us, they will ask for input and feedback first. I really hope so.

## Week 10 (SEM 1 WK 10)

Due to the amount of work that was put into this course last week, I have not done anything active outside of the project meetings this week. This was a choice to even out the hours between my courses and to catch up on everything I put aside last week. The impression I got from our team meeting was that this was the same for nearly every team member this week as well.

### Team Mates Work

While the majority of the team didn't do any work this week for the same reasons as I did, there were a few people who did go away and do a little bit of work which I think was worthwhile. Seb did a really good job at looking at options for object detection for the vision module. As I have been taking computer vision this semester, I already had a bit of an idea about ways to do this that I hadn't talked to him about. He came back with more information than I knew - and about the feasibility of each of the different algorithms he mentioned with was great! I can't remember the exact name of the one he was going to go away and try and implement, but I am very excited to see his results when he gets a chance to do so.

One of the discussions we have been having in the group meetings is compatibility of documentation. Because we are in computer science, it seems everyone has different opinions on what type of documentation program we should be using. While Microsoft word was chosen as the main type, there were team members who did not have the Microsoft suit installed on their computers, and consequently had issues opening them and using git at the same time. Greg went away to look at how to make the Microsoft work docx files more compatible with libre office files, and also ways to automatically generate PDFs of these files before you push them to git. I am highly in favour of automatically generating PDFs because I prefer reading them on a computer than word documents. I also find them more professional. While I don't think there was a definite solution as of yet, I think having this conversation was a good way forward for the team. I am not sure how important this issue would be in a workplace, as I feel the workplace would already have established expectations of programs, all which are provided on the machines you use. It could be useful knowledge for start-ups however. Greg also followed through the style guide debacle from last week with a basic "software guide template draft". We were asked to provide feedback on the template, however personally for me, the template is empty so I will have to follow this up at a later point.

### Project Meeting - Technical Workshop Follow-Up

In the team meeting this week I led a follow up on the technical workshop which allowed us all to achieve the short term goals from the technical workshop at the end of Week 8. At this point I had noticed a few minor things we hadn't thought through which I presented to the team when we reviewed the requirements table, and this helped solidify the concept of the project for everyone. We also reviewed some of the use cases and sequence diagrams I had started in the previous week to come to help share the same view of how the system would work. But most importantly we were successfully able to narrow down the scope of the project.

In stage one, you have to be able to participate in 2 of 5 challenges to enter into the competition. This meant that we had to choose out of these challenges 2 that we felt were achievable and appropriate. Because we have not solved the problem of who will be working on the mapping part of the project, we felt that it was important to choose challenges that we can work on without going too far into the mapping this year.

In hindsight, the team should have sat down at the start of semester to determine the MVP of this project. I understand that lack of expertees in the areas we were going into were hindering this, but sometimes it seems the project got off to a slow start. It would have been more useful to have a direction that we needed to go forward with, but I also understand that there are many factors that do make this difficult to achieve.

I am starting to consider that maybe I want a go being a project manager next year, because I seem to enjoy the leadership stuff in the PAL program. Looking at this experience, I think the initial meeting for the team next year needs to clearly set the direction and MVP for that year in the first meeting. Roles need to be determined and the vision needs to be set. I think this will be important in the teams success or failure.

## Week 11 (SEM 1 WK 11)
This week, while a lot has been achieved, was a pretty slow week in terms of events. The team meeting this week was quite a quick one with everyone checking in and updating the rest of us. Personally I spent a lot of my time starting to flesh out the use cases and drafting the matching sequence diagrams, as well as catch up on my learning portfolio. A lot of team members have been sick this week which didn't help the productivity levels.

### Systems Architecture

I spent a lot of time this week working on the use cases and sequence diagrams to match them. Due to the amount of different parts to the system and the capabilities, I spent quite a lot of time narrowing down the list to what is achievable in the time frame I have. I have not come across use cases before, and they seem foreign at the moment. Especially with how one leads into another, and how they all interact together - which is shown particularly well with the sequence diagrams. The idea of pre-requisites is interesting with these as well. I think I am slowly getting the hang of it, but I will have to go through all of this with my mentor when he returns from Robocup China at the start of next semester. I ambitiously said at the meeting I was hoping to baseline these, but honestly that wont happen for a while. I think the time frame that I am going to have to work towards is a lot more long term that I originally thought. Especially because I have some final exams scheduled in Week 13.

### Team Mates

Both Magic and Chris seemed to have a rough week being sick. I know Chris worked towards the Australian Speech Dictionary, and Magic has been looking at the use of neural networks for face recognition, but overall I think they spent more time in bed than at uni. I think Chris discovering in previous weeks that the speech dictionaries already out there don't work with the Australian accents is a bit of a setback. It is one of those hidden traps in our system that we didn't consider would be an issue. Due to Chris being sick, it meant we didn't get much of an update this week, but I am interested to see if we have to work towards building an Australian Dictionary, or if there is another work around. Maybe we all are going to have to speak in American accents...

I am concerned about Cameron and how he is going with his part of the project. I think that even though he has been assigned a part of the project to work on, and he has researched extensively about his component, he is still lacking direction. I think he is being put off the project because he is having trouble getting over the initial hurdle of starting. I think the PMs are watching out for this, but it will need to be dealt with next semester if it continues.

Jess and Greg did a great job meeting up with Liam Waldron this week to set up the Engineering part of the project. They have also started to meet up with Sophie regularly which has had a huge impact on the direction of the project and the way the PMs are leading the team. Having someone that can guide them and answer their questions has been a major success and definitely needs to be passed on. When selecting a mentor for any project, it seems that having a mentor for everyone including the leader is important. Everyone in the team needs someone that they can ask the difficult questions to. This might be the issue for some of the other team members and how they are progressing in the project. I know that Magic and I have both found mentors for the parts of the project we are working on, and it seems that we are getting a lot more done for the same time frame in the meetings. I think it would be very beneficial to set up the mentoring scheme that was discussed in Term 1, and I know that this is something the PMs are working towards. I would like to see this be prioritized though.

## Week 12 (SEM 1 WK 12)

### Team Name

A lot of the meeting this week was spent brainstorming a team name, and while many ideas were shared and suggested, we didn't get anywhere particular at this meeting. We went through white boards worth of information and came up with many concepts for the team name as well as the robot name. What I have learnt is naming things meaningfully is incredibly difficult. Unbelievably so. The reason behind naming the team officially is apparently we have been swapping between ANU@Home and Robocup@Home which has caused confusion. It is another good step forward for the long term set up of this team and project. Coming into the meeting not knowing that we were going to have to brainstorm names probably wasn't the best choice made by the PMs but we got there in the end. I think that this would have taken less time and had a more successful outcome if we had a chance to think about it more prior to meeting up with everyone.

### My Work this Week

This week I have spent a bit more time cleaning up my learning portfolio and working a tiny bit more more on the sequence diagrams. I think I have got my head around the simplistic version my mentor talked me through and showed me examples of. At some point once I have finished the simplistic versions of one or two use cases, I am going to have to go through and document how different inputs or actions will effect the sequences differently, and the conditions that this sequence should start to run. I can't remember the technical term for these because I forgot to write it down. I will have to ask my mentor when I next see him. I know going into the last week of term I will get nothing done next week. I made mentioned this in the project meeting this week.

### My Teams Work this Week

I think the project has started to stagnate this week. A lot of people seem to have more commitments from other courses that maybe what is best. It is good to see that the PMs are more relaxed about not requiring the 10hours weekly, and letting people make it up. From what I can tell, Seb has done a little on computer vision and researched about neural nets. I know these are quite complex, and I have a feeling that they are going to be required for the project. I am a little unsure of the work that Jess or Greg have achieved this week. I know that Magic and Chris have not had a chance to do any work, but will have time at some point. As per normal, at the moment I really am unsure what Cameron is doing, if anything at all. Supposedly he is still researching and hasn't attempted anything.

## Week 13 (SEM 1 WK 13)
There was a team decision to stop all work at the end of last week and for us to make up the 10 hours in the holidays. Thus, week 14 (i.e. Semester 2 Week 1) will have a longer reflection compared to this week. As far as I am aware, this will be the case for all team members until after exam period.

## Week 14 (SEM 2 WK 1)
There was no team meeting the first week back of uni, which made it quite difficult to start up and catch up with everyone. The first meeting is set for next week. So a lot of this week was just keeping on going with the stuff I started in the holidays, and hope that next week that the project was pulled more on track.

### Mid-Year Break / High Level Architecture

Not amazing amounts were done over this holidays. I really just treated this as a holiday. I did get a bit of work done reviewing examples of High Level Design Documents which i should be aiming to complete by the end of the year. This was actually super useful to give me some direction and an indication of how much work I have done, and still have to do. I am starting to really see the big picture on why this is important, and useful for the future. When we get to integration, I can see it being highly useful.

### Technical Meeting \#1

It has been really positive to see that the idea and success of the first technical meeting is being applied and past through on the project. The technical meeting during the holidays - for the project timeline - was successful and I feel everyone came out of it even more positive again. It gave most people a clearer direction forward.

### Project Timeline

Some time was spent in the holidays developing a timeline for this project for the rest of the year. The meeting was attended by everyone except Jess, and was meant to be lead by Greg. For the first part of this meeting, we went around and around in circles. I honestly felt it was a bit of a waste of time after the fourth or fifth time we were talking about what we want to achieve by the end of the year, and the answer not changing. I ended up getting a little infuriated with this and got paper which I stuck on the walls. I drew in the clear lines for deadlines, including course deadlines and other events like ANU open day. I got the team to write out what they wanted to achieve, and then we positioned them at different points on the timeline, and marked the interactions between everyones goals, which all lead to the common larger goal.

In hindsight, I probably should not have taken over the way I did in this context. I probably should have zoned out a bit from the meeting and let Greg move it to where he wanted it to go. Even though we reached the same end point, It may not have been the best way forward. I think the other problem with calling this in the holidays, is that our timeline is just a guess. In the big picture of things, we actually have no idea how long some of these things will take us, and the timeline potentially could just be for show more than for anything else.

### Robocup International China 2015

Robocup International 2015 was run over this holidays. While I did not get to attend, I did get access to all of the documents which are given out to all people in the competition. These include questions that the robot is meant to be able to answer, objects the robot must need to recognize, names the robot needs to know and a map of the arena. Additionally, Sophie has taken a whole heap of photos of the competition which will prove to be a valuable resource later down the track. I have put all the resources that both myself and Sophie have gathered onto the gitlab folder for all the team to see.

### Learning Portfolio Requirements

One of the things I have spent the holidays doing is going over my learning portfolio to check everything up to this point is up to date. This has obviously required me to look at the marking criteria so that I can achieve the best possible mark I can get for this. Doing this raised a concern about getting marks for providing citations as references (and referencing them correctly). Personally my resources have been in person or confidential documents which I am not allowed to release. The only Internet or book resource I have used to date is the occasional use of a wikipedia page, which seems not so valuable to the learning portfolio. So for me this seems a little unachievable because there is nothing I can post Online to reference. Thus, this is something I need talk to Shayne about.

## Week 15 (SEM 2 WK 2)
This week has been a bit of a disaster for me. I didn't make the team meeting this week to very complicated personal events which were completely out of my control. I entered into a project meeting with no understanding of where the project had gone in the past week or two because the team meeting last week had a different focus to catching everyone up.

### High Level Architecture

The work I have done this week has been starting to get the sequential diagrams actually drawn up. I have also started a very basic draft of the component descriptions of how the software and hardware link together. I know this should be really useful, especially when it comes to the engineering team requiring more help forward in their design decisions.

### Project Review

This project review was not as good as the previous one, and I don't think it helped that the team went in very under-prepared. I think a lot of us went in with the expectations that we were on the right track and had done really well in the time between the two project reviews. I think the biggest outcome of the project review was that we need to start the integration. Shayne seemed to think that we already should have started integration, but I don't actually think that would have been possible. As a team I don't think we were ready to go any further.

The other big picture thing that came out of the project review was that the way we are using our resources as a team is really quite poor. To be honest, I could have guessed this considering up until this meeting, I was pretty well the only technical person pushing to the repository on a normal basis. Hopefully this will now fix itself.

## Week 16 (SEM 2 WK 3)
This week has been a bit of a slow week - most of us were still recovering from preparation for the project review last week.

### My Work - High Level Architecture

To date, a lot of my stuff has been done by hand, or researching - which was what most of the team has done to date. Other than starting to actually draw out different bits or bobs, I haven't had a chance to contribute much this week.

### Team Mates

One of the really good step forward this week is the use of gitlab. All of a sudden pretty well everyone in the team has started using gitlab a lot more regularly, and properly. There are a lot more branches and buts and bobs popping up on the repository which is really really good to see. It is also nice because we can actually look and see what people are doing.

This week Magic's work has been quite impressive. He has been working on getting a neural net working and it is fairly accurate so far. It is pretty clear on the relevance, especially since it does a lot of the requirements for challenge 5.4 by recognizing gender, emotion and glasses. It will be interesting to see where he goes further here, especially in terms of describing a human given the visual input. His code is a little messy and hard to understand at this point in time, but I am hoping that this will fix itself with time.

Seb has started working more on the documentation which was really useful when looking at his work. He has been using the wiki pages attached to the gitlab, way better than everyone else including myself. I am yet to see how his object recognition actually is going.

While I have seen a lot of Chris's work away from the team meeting, I know that a lot of people probably have no idea what he is up to. He seems to be battling with different libraries and actually getting his code to work across platform. I feel Cameron is having even less of a part of the team, and it seems to just be getting worse. He supposedly researched Levenshtein Edit Distance, but he couldn't really talk about it or answer any questions from what I could see.

## Week 17 (SEM 2 WK 4)
This week has been a bit of a slow in terms of moving forward as a team. Considering that this was the first tutor meeting, everything was a little new and unexpected. Our team meeting basically turned into a mini project review. Granted, I think the longest one will have been this week, considering that we all have now learnt what to expect.

### High Level Architecture

This week I decided to leave everything to date and start drawing out the logical diagrams for the challenges we decided to aim to achieve. The logical diagrams are a lot harder than I originally thought. They were more complex and there was a lot more to consider than I first thought. What they did start to show me was that the contextual and conceptual stuff that has been consistently reviewed are possible at the point that they dont need any major revisions any more. And this makes me quite proud that I have got it this far.

### Tutor Meeting

I dont think there is much to take away from the tutor meeting this week other than we have made a good step in the right direction. Hopefully we continue going this way.

### Team Mates

Because of the meeting which was replaced by the tutor meeting this week, I really am unsure about what my team has actually achieved this week. I know about magic working towards refactoring his code, and chris doing the same, but I have no idea for Cameron or Seb.

## Week 18 (SEM 2 WK 5)

This week has been a pretty productive week in terms of moving forward for integration. Most of the team has worked soundly together which is nice to see.

### My Work - High Level Architecture

A lot of my week has been spent meeting with my mentor, and fleshing out component tables. The work I started on in previous weeks required more detail and stuff that I hadn't considered. The component tables, while definitely not finished, are definitely a good way forward in defining the problem and preserving the project for the future. Other than the many hours spent reviewing my work with my mentor, getting more of a direction, and fixing the component tables, my time has been spent keeping the momentum going with the integration. While I haven't done a lot of coding for this part of the project, I feel that I have kept a lot of people working together in the right direction.

### Team Mates and Meeting

This week Chris, Seb and Magic have seemed to get all their code nearly ready for integration.

Chris's work has moved away from recording for 10 seconds, and towards real time. He has also spent way to long trying to get ROS to work on a machine for everyone. While this seems to be an important step forward - I don't think that this is achievable. Everyone uses different machines, or virtual machines, and realistically a way for everyone to install the necessary things is a better way to do this than giving everyone a copy of the machine to use. Alternatively we need to set up a machine that we can all access as a way forward.

Seb's work has started to recognize more complex objects which is a good step forward for the project. It will be interesting with the current implementation to see if what has been done is relevant in the future. The current way seems to be quite naive and doesn't have the ability to learn without already having a photo in its database, which will cause issues with storage.

Cameron is still a very large issue in my eyes. I still have no idea what he has actually spent any time doing. He has reported to the team where he has supposedly written some code to match strings to input phrases, but he still has nothing to show at meetings. He hasn't attend any time that we have met up and worked on the integration as a group. Which has been quite frequently.

### Integration Work

There was a meeting with Seb, Chris and Greg that ran while I was tutoring, which I dropped into towards the end. The purpose of the meeting was to start to integrate everyones different parts. Unfortunately with this meeting, by the time I got there, all they seemed to have done was to design what the integration would look like. What was even more disappointing for me was that their entire design matched all the work I have done to date, and had shown and asked for a review of many times. It is quite clear that no one cares about what I am doing, or sees the purpose of the work I have done to date.

Additionally, this weekend Seb, Magic, Chris and I met up and really took the integration that one step further. While we made a design decision as a group to move away from ROS for the integration for open day, and to just to pipe everything together into a single python script. While not robust, or nor what we want to do in the future, we needed to get a simple way forward for open day. Over the course of the afternoon and night we managed to fully integrate Chris's, Seb's and Magic's stuff working fairly well together in this way. While there is still a lot of stuff to do in the next week.

## Week 19 (SEM 2 WK 6)
This week has been a very up and down for the project. We managed to come through as a team and get the integration ready for open day, which I am told went well. I also had a pretty major run in with the PMs as a result from their individual meetings with each member of the team.

### Team Mates and Integration

The team this week has really pulled together to make the integration work. Considering that Open day was this weekend, so hours have been spent trying to bring all the final touches together. I think everyone except Cameron really came through this week. Everyone had all their stuff working together before open day, where Cameron pushed a half finished thing to the repository on the Friday night before ANU open day. We ended up taking the cereal box idea from Shayne and it seemed to work really really well from what I saw and heard. To be honest, I am yet to see the fully working copy from open day. Maybe next week.

### Individual Meetings with PM

This meeting was quite offensive and upset me quite a lot. I was told to date that the work I have done is useless to the project currently, and is being done to too high of a quality. I was told to stop doing a resume document, and to start doing a 'quick and dirty' job so I can actually help the team. Clearly the PMs do not value anything I have done, and unfortunately based on marks, nor does my team. The fact that they believe I am doing my university work to a high quality to fill my resume was highly offensive, and never crossed my mind. While there were a few minor bits of constructive feedback, this meeting was a very negative experience.

### High Level Architecture

As a result of the Individual meeting, I spent this week wrapping up the architecture while helping out with the integration. Considering that nothing I have done is relevant or useful to the project, and that a 'quick and dirty' should be done to bring it together, this is exactly what I did. There is now an high level architecture overview sitting in the architecture folder, which is abotu one third of the document quality I was hoping to finish by the end of the semester. I didn't review anything to make sure it was of high quality or up to date. All I simply did was throw it together. Unfortunately I didn't finish a lot of what I set out to do, however based on the fact that this is a team project and my peers determine my mark, I have to work on something that is beneficial for me rather that let everyone mark me down for doing something that was necessary for the team. The architecture as a whole is important to bring the system together. Clearly this is lost in this project.

## Week 20 (SEM 2 WK 7)
There was a team decision to stop all work at the beginning of this week and for us to make up the 10 hours in the mid-term break if we didn't already exceed the 10 hours before this. A lot of us spent the time meant for this week, during the previous fortnight making sure that we met the integration requirements for open day.

### PM Problem

The only other thing I have done to do with this project is to have a talk with the PMs which resulted from the individual meetings held last week. Obviously in the previous weeks reflection I have talked about some of the stuff that has arisen from this meeting. To be honest, all that really came from their 'chat' with me was that they apologised for being offensive, and they told me I could stop on architecure, but gave me no where to go into. I don't know if I am now required to work on the control centre part of ROS or if I am allowed to work on computer vision. I guess I will find out after the break...

## Week 21 (SEM 2 WK 8)
It is quite clear that the PM's have attempted to get their act together in the term break. To be honest, I didn't do much in terms of this project over the holidays. Motivation for this course after the holidays has improved a little bit but honestly i don't feel all that great about the project given the previous few weeks. It has finally been decided on this week what I will be doing for the remainder of the term, and long behold it is nothing that I hoped to do, or that was discussed at the end of week 7. What I am to work on for the remainder of this project is the control system and actually making ROS be implemented the way it should be. I guess this is a good and a bad thing realistically. The good thing is that it is linked to everything I have done to date. It strongly links all the architecture to the integration of everyones parts. Clearly I guess that makes sense. The issue with all of this is that I have no idea really how ROS works, from what people have said I don't think it is the right thing for the job, and that the outcome is still the same as back when I got put on architecture - it isn't something I wanted to do. I guess someone has to take one for the team.

As a team we are slowly moving towards integration. While it seems to be going well and good in the right direction, I sometimes wonder if we are doing this correctly. I think it may have been worth actually building our own framework from scratch rather than using ROS. It would have allowed for more capabilities and less issues with integration I imagine. This is what it was designed to be. Never the less, we are not working together towards getting everything that has been done so far together before the final project review. this was helped by the PMs proposing a project objectives document to work towards for the final 4 weeks. I guess the catch was that Shayne wasn't very impressed by it this late into the project, and that it is still a case that this has not been accepted by the entire team yet. I think that is the case at the next meeting, which I am unable to make it to.

I keep coming back to this project and reflecting on what went wrong, especially since I have now taken up the job as CSSA President. I think the first mistake was asking people to do something they aren't interested in. And I think this is a very difficult thing to work around, but given that we are a student project, we should have had more of a say that the 4th years choosing what they wanted us to do. And I actually think this is one of the most important things to take away. In the case of the CSSA, it is super important to make sure everyone is doing what they want to do, because it is done on your own time. But in the case of the new committee, it is important to have someone who is looking after industry and sponsorship. The trouble was that no one who was voted in wanted this position, and that really left me in a pickle. It was a case of do I ask someone to spend a year doing a job they don't want, or do I suggest appointing an additional person to the committee for that particular role. This did take a lot of reflection on this year for me to work out the second option was the better option. I guess this lesson was one from experience. I think as a leader, it is provide the individual a say on what they want to work on, rather than tell them. To be honest, I know that I am about to go on as much of a learning journey in the next 12 months being president as the 4th years in this team have this year. It is really a case of everyone makes mistakes and you learn from them.

## Week 22 (SEM 2 WK 9)
This week we got to finally agree on the project objectives document. Between drafts and the updates it really looks quite good. I honestly don't think the 'musts' are all achievable in the upcoming weeks. All of my time this week has gone into completing the buckets and buckets of ROS tutorials. I would hope to think that now I am a bit of an expert in how ROS works and that it shouldn't take me long to start redoing the integration from open day into an appropriate modular approach. I get the impression that even though Chris and I have been asked to set up the ROS framework and get the control centre happening, that Greg and Seb are attempting to do exactly the same thing. I think there has began a communication breakdown in the team which really isn't a good sign. Cameron as per normal has not done a thing. I think we are all trying to work towards the same goal, but realistically this lack of communication is actually I think stopping us reach the goal. I can see what I have been assigned to work on with Chris is to make sure the structure we are using can be worked upon by many teams in the future.

Sometimes I wonder if some of this emphasis on handover is contradicting what we are being asked to do. I think this is actually something to be aware of as a leader. I think presenting the team you are leading with a clear goal is quite important for the functioning of the team. Even if there are many different things that need to be done, these parts normally join up to an overarching goal. I think that this is something the project has been missing, and possibly still is. Looking at the project objectives document - yes these are things that we need to achieve to complete the work we have done this year. The thing is, this document is missing things about getting ready for handover. It is missing objectives about documentation which is important to every project. I think that there is still a very big distinction between completing work and documenting work. In software engineering and team projects I think this distinction hinders. This has been something I have been really mulling over as president of the CSSA. Because I am leading a team with many different personal goals, I have to find a way to bring these together and to encapsulate everything. It is something that is easier said than done, and my guess is that it becomes easier with time.

Looking at the project objectives document this week has made me feel like as a team we have achieved a fair amount, but personally I have achieved nothing. I think the issue I really have with this document is that everyone except me has something they can point to and say they have worked on to date. Nothing I have been asked to do throughout the entire year has been included in that document. Some of the stuff worries me as well - there is a lot of computer vision stuff which will be ticked off, but in terms of the speech processing stuff, nothing has even been partially ticked off. And I guess this is a downfall of teamwork. Cameron has once again done nothing to contribute to the project and I think because of this it is meaning that we are not achieving as much as we should be for a team of 7 people.

## Week 24 (SEM 2 WK 11)
This week has been one of the most tough weeks for me for in terms of balancing this project with the rest of my workload. In the meeting on Tuesday morning, the 4th years finally realised that what they asked Chris and I to do was actually redundant and then decided to get us to do other things. The only issue with that is that the list I came out with was unachievable in only a week if I put the single 10 hours to it. I was asked to get the kinect camera up and going. The thing with the kinect camera is that for programming purposes, a combination of libraries is required.  The fun fact of the week is recently one of those libraries has changed from openly available to brought by apple. Good times.

I guess the reason that the kinect was so important to get before the project review and showcase is because the team was hoping for gesture recognition. This isn't possible given the time frame and library issues, but hopefully it could be possible in the future.

So obviously I have eluded to the fact that there were many issues this week. The first lot of issues arose when installing the first library. It happens that the install instructions are different depending where you look for Libfreenect. The biggest issue here is that because of this, installing is a nightmare. It took me way longer than I would have hoped to work out why the library itself and then the wrappers wouldn't install, and it was all because of one prerequisite library not being the right release. I also worked out that different operating systems have sligthly different prerequisite libraries to make the wrappers work. I think the smartest thing I did while dealing with these issues was that I started building a make script as I went. When I went to install it on Magics computer, it happened flawlessly which meant I did a really good job of it which was nice to know.

The second lot of fun I had this week was when I did get the kinect working after more than 15 hours of work, everything I had done and pushed to the repo was then overwritten by some of the people on the team because they couldn't test it on their personal computer. Rather than comment out things or try and work with me so it worked on their machine, they just deleted it. Lucky for repos you can revert, but honestly I was beyond caring at this point to do anything more about it. I think because of this a lot was lost. I had the kinect producing both the RGB video stream and the matching depth map that goes with it.

Next time I think I need to be clear that asking for a new undeveloped feature this close to the due date is not a viable possibility and talk to someone outside the project I am working on to gain some strategies for doing this without upsetting anyone.

## Week 25 (SEM 2 WK 12)
This week has been all about getting the project review up and going, and about ticking off the project objectives. To be honest, I have just been trying to keep up with everything this week and doing what is required of me, but the project review was interesting to say the least. I wish the PMs actually showed us and walked through with us what they were planning on presenting in the review. This was a mistake I made back at the first project review, which I remade this time. I personally disagreed with some of the stuff said at that review, and what this really taught me was that regardless of where you stand in a team, if it is not at the top then what you say doesn't matter. The review is all about making the top dog of the team look like they are doing a good job and asserting their opinion onto others. I think this is something that happens more times than not and is a good thing to be aware of. To be honest, it is also just life.
## Week 26 (SEM 2 WK 13)
To be honest, this week has been a bit surreal. I guess ultimately we have spent so long on this project, that for it to come to an end doesn't feel quite right. Looking back on it, at the start of the project I was very naive. I hadn't experienced many of the hard stuff that came with teamwork. I hadn't experienced having next to no say in a team. I guess it is good to say that I learnt a lot. There are realistically two questions I need to answer to really review my year in a personal sense.

    #### What have I worked on this year and what have I achieved?
    For this project, the majority of my time has been spent designing the system and building the architecture documents up for it. I guess the biggest thing I contributed was the modular framework which our project should be able to reflect in future years. Towards the end, because of issues which arose at the end of term 3, my work shifted to the control centre, ROS framework and CV pre-processing. To be honest, I don't really view anything I have done as much of an achievement since term 4. It was honestly work to keep everyone else happy and wasn't up to the standard of the work prior to this. I do think that the architecture work I did should be viewed as a large achievement personally. I came from not really understanding system design or the complexities of it, to having the system designed in a way that should be future proof.

    #### What have I learnt this year and what hindsights were gained?
    I think the biggest things I have learnt this year have had nothing to do with the work I was actually doing. I mean I did learn a lot about system design and this was extremely useful. But honestly the most I learnt was what not to do when it comes to leading a team, and working in a team.

### Project Showcase

Given the time constraints, I didn't spend as long as I would have liked to at the project showcase. I guess because of this, It didn't really feel like a big success to me. From the time I did spend there, what I worked out was that the stuff we did was actually quite cool. It was a lot more outside the box and conceptually harder than a lot of the other projects. The other projects really just seemed like software implementation than the research and discovery that we got to do. I don't think if I was part of the other groups I would have had the experience I did with this project in terms of intellectually interesting. That said, maybe one of the other projects would not have taught me the stuff I have now learnt about leading teams.
