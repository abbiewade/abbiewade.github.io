This course, Systems Engineering for Software Engineers, is a compulsory course required for me to take as part of the undergraduate degree I am working towards. As part of this course it is a requirement that we keep a learning portfolio, both answering questions and reflecting on the week that has passed. We are required to draw links to what we are working towards and past experiences where the situation or skill would have been useful. Enjoy the reflections below.

# Week 1: Course introduction

One lecture in and I am already feeling quite positive about this course. There are many considerations that I had not even considered taking that I really should have been - such as really seeing the system as a whole. I loved all the story telling in the first lecture - particularly the one about London Dispatch. I had no idea that actually happened and I am a little shocked that it did. It really showed you that a system is not just the software. It is the hardware, company working towards it, and most of all the people, and communication between all parts of the system at times can be really difficult.

Dr Stephen Ellis was a interesting guest speaker to start off the course, especially since I get the feeling that he sometimes eluded to content that we would cover in further depth later down the track. I liked how he put things in perspective - such as the further away from the event where the system failed you are, the more perspective of the bigger picture you can gain. I had never really thought about records of previous events being considered useless when they were out of order (because of lack of context, and consequently reliability and consistency being questioned). It makes a lot of sense, not just with systems engineering but life itself. When you tell a story, if you don't tell it in order and give the details that come first, people are going to be very lost. I know keeping records by date order is something that most people do naturally (and I feel that I am one of them) however I have never had to explicitly think about it in this particular way.

The alphabet example about context was equally as interesting. I think the explicit point he was trying to make about assumptions being brought to the project was one of the things I really took away. One of my jobs is as a PAL Senior Mentor for computer science. The team I am leading this year has two new mentors and something I really need to do is make an effort to make sure I don't assume that they know things that I learnt from PAL in the past. But it doesn't stop there - the new mentors will have expectations of me which I need to identify, refine and follow through on. As a team we all need to be in a position with realistic expectations and assumptions so that as a team we can make a more valuable contribution to the PAL program.

## What do you hope to gain by taking this course?

Hopefully I will leave the semester with more of an understanding that I currently have about system engineering. I am hoping that I can find ways to apply gained knowledge now - whether in the Techlauncher Project or PAL or otherwise. I want to be able to conceptualize a big picture of how everything fits together - I get the feeling that the umbrella term of systems engineering is protecting a lot of people from the rain. To be honest, I want to sit back for the ride and learn a whole heap of different views and concepts that had not occurred to me told by people who have actually experienced it. In PAL we have a concept called story telling, where the idea is you tell stories to share successes, fails, etc. to provide motivation to the people you are telling the story to. I guess ultimately I am hoping to get motivated.

##Example of System Failure Blamed on Software where other 'system' issues were contributing factors

This one took a little bit of finding on Google but hopefully it works. Back in June 2012 RBS were performing an update to the computer to deal with technical issues related to payment processing for many computers part of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group. The update which was applied failed and caused many customers to have no access to their accounts for up to two weeks, including making and receiving transactions. This problem also meant that some customers were charged twice, payments were lost, among other issues. As part of the official statement, RBS said "The immediate software issue was promptly identified and rectified. Despite this, significant manual intervention in a highly automated and complex batch processing environment was required. This resulted in a significant backlog of daily data and information processing." RBS blamed the problem on the software, but in actual fact if the software had been tested before it was released, the system would not have failed. Potentially there was issue with lack of sufficient or relevant documentation, time deadlines and money influencing the 'too early' software update as well.

# Week 2: Systems Thinking

I didn't realize coming into this lecture that systems thinking was something I already do on a base level (at least). I think the best way for this week is to just jump straight into the prompt questions. Enjoy.

## Think about the ways in which systems thinking may interact with analytical thinking.

Analytical thinking acts as triggers for systems thinking. When thinking systems based, you need to be able to look at the big picture and this is where analytical thinking comes in. While part of systems thinking is analyzing the situation in preparation for what to do next, it acts more as feedback for what the system thinking requires you to do. A good example of this might be the example Grisha and I did in class about constructing flood-control levees and its feedback loop. Part of the feedback loop was flooding the city, and the next part in the cycle was building a levee. The arrow connecting this two required analytical thinking to develop a solution which seemed to solve the previous issue.

## Tell us about a problem you have recently worked on. What kind of thinking did you use to solve the problem? If you didn't use systems thinking, could it have helped in understanding or solving the problem?

PAL has a lot of concepts which are fundamentally based around working out what the students actually needs and what is acting as a road block for the student rather than what the students are asking for directly. Often what the students feels they want isn't actually what they need help with. For most of the tools that we use as a PAL mentor to diagnose what the student needs, we use a few techniques but all of them involve something the mentors nickname blackpen-bluepen. The basic concept behind it is, once we have identified that something is wrong (usually by contradiction or observation) we go back and recall actual examples in a black pen, and then when we get up to it, we analyze the story in blue pen until we reach the conclusions of what we are looking for, whether it was a perception, a thinking process or otherwise.

Another part of PAL which I think needs to be identified as a systems thinking approach is the work done by mentors with regards to developing thinking processes. Part of the work put into thinking processes is triggers for when students are up to set parts of the thinking process, or when they are straying off track. In terms of this course, they are part of the feedback loop for if the thinking process is effectively being taught to the student. A lot of the thinking which goes on behind the scenes for PAL is to do with feedback. We ask ourselves questions like what went well, what went wrong, what do we need to change, was that session actually successful in achieving what we set out to do? Even as a senior mentor when writing reports, the majority of the time is spent thinking and reflecting on what needs to be done and what has been done. I guess the idea of continuous reflection is a part of systems thinking, but not the whole story.

## Ways in which systems thinking might help within the context of Upcoming Topics

Systems thinking requires a knowledge of the big picture, but also knowing each part in detail. This course seems to be designed around the fact that there are skills needed for systems engineering, and each of these skills has many different complex parts to them. To become a good software engineer that thinks in a systems approach, we need to understand the different topics being presented each week, and then piece them together to form a big picture - a global understanding of what the course is trying to teach us.

# Week 3: The Engineering Context

The context of being in a computer engineering role in a system is something I have not had to consider before this week. I think though one of the most interesting points brought up in the panel would have to be the one about the aims and context of a project. I hadn't really thought about how some systems are released even know they know there are defects, and others are released only when all known defects have been fixed and that the context of the situation is what determines this.

There is definitely a connection between the engineering context and systems thinking. The engineering context is definitely a skill you need to be a systems thinker. In my lab we did an activity where we needed to first write specifications for a task, and then that specification went to another group for them to draw a diagram of. This diagram was then past to yet another group to build out of Lego. Everything was brought back in at the end. It really came to show though that unless the specification is atomic, verifiable and unambiguous then they really are useless. To be honest though this applies when you are thinking about a system. When using systems thinking you have to look from all the different perspectives and actually verify that it would work. For a really large system, the solution would have to be atomic - if it was dynamic it would cause a headache trying to keep every little component working together.

## Personal Context
At this point, I am not really sure of my career ambitions. I guess this makes the question of what context do you want to work and how that changes things that would concern me. In terms of the techlauncher project I am working on - this project's context is that is needs to be robust to the rules. While other teams have specifications and generally one end goal, this project is unique in the sense that there is the sub-end points required to make a working robot. We have to be able to get the robot to complete many different tasks all at the same time (e.g. computer vision and speech). Things that will concern my team on this project will be things like getting all the different parts linking together. We need to make sure that everything is robust and designed in a way that one minor change to a subpart doesn't blow up the entire program. I guess by robust to the rules is that we have to be able to do the requirements given so that we can be awarded points when we complete the challenge.

## What it is to be an Engineer?

Engineers are the visionaries of the world. We are team workers. We dream and aspire about ways to make the world a better place and improve the way we live. We are experimenters, innovators and problem solvers. We take concepts and make them reality. We are building the todays future. I feel that I identify with this group of people. I want to innovate, I want to design and I want to create. In terms of being an engineer in a system though, the restriction of doing all of the above in the required time and meeting all requirements at the level required is part of being an engineer as well.

## The responsibilities of engineers and their impact on Society

In terms of the team work that is required when you are an engineer - we have a responsibility to deliver the components we are working on in a team at the correct time and in a form that works and solves the problem. Other than this explicit point under this heading, other relating topics that I have talked about are writen in this post - such as what it means to be an engineer.

## Ethical Perspectives and Considerations from Things I have done as part of a Larger Team

I have never been questioned from an ethical perspective on work I completed as part of a larger team. However, I do understand that ethnics will play a large role in the reasoning behind why something is done. I guess I have just accepted that it is important, but never thought about it deeper because I have never needed to. Ethical perspectives in my eyes is problems which take multitudes of complexity that make it impossible to form a simple answer.

I guess the closest thing recently from what I have had to consider ethical perspectives as part of a larger team is inviting people to be part of the robocup team I have been building this year. I have had to consider and solve problems like how to make this a viable project which will be adopted by ANU for years to come. This meant I have had to factor things like budgeting, continuity, and group dynamics to start the group off. There aren't amazing amounts of ethical perspectives to consider here, but the simple one of building a team which has the aim of working on a project for years to come means that the start up year has to be strong in terms of team work, idea, ability to see the future and a way forward and be enthusiastic.

# Week 4: Design Thinking

I think the way that Darren defined design thinking is an important way to start this weeks reflection. He stated that design thinking is solving societies most complex problems by thinking in a different way. As design thinkers we need to look for opportunities for change so that we can design things in better ways and make improvements. We need to ask what went wrong and where the breakdown is and work out ways to fix the problem. He was very true in saying that normally, the places where complex systems fail aren't always the most obvious place. I think his example where he documented his medical experience was a very powerful example - particularly because it really made the point of what design thinking actually is. I had spent a lot of time trying to understand what design thinking was before this lecture because I was part of a team to facilitate the tutorial on this topic, but after this lecture I realized that I still didn't know everything. In a sense this seems more than just a way of thinking. It also seems as though there is a way to follow through and fix what you were thinking about. It didn't really occur to me until the lecture that design thinking generally targets problems that are too complex to be solved normally. All the examples given on the Internet are trivial problems in a sense - for example ways to travel on your bike while you have coffee, or wallet design. They weren't talking about problems that have high risks of going wrong, or that can be life changing or saving.

One of the things I have come to realize is that design thinking can be used in parts. I think that of all the different methods of thinking presented to us, maybe it is more beneficial for us to take parts of each one rather than stick to one as the be all and end all. I talk about parts of design thinking a bit more below, particularly in the sense that not all has to be used and that it is situational based.

## PAL, Pathway Mapping and Discovery Interviewing

I wanted to go into a little more detail about what was said about pathway mapping and discovery interviewing than just a passing comment. Pathway mapping was presented as a way we map a persons journey including interactions with a system (particularly useful in identifying pain points of the system). We were presented with 10 steps used in discovery interviewing which I used my personal lecture notes to summaries below.

  - Focusing Questions
  - Open Questions
  - Probe
  - Silence and Neutral Encouragement
  - Avoid Why
  - Follow the white rabbit
  - Avoid Leading Questions
  - Ask for Stories
  - Quotes
  - No Harm

As the heading states, I want to bring this back to PAL. There seem to be many similarities to PAL and design thinking - but for now I only want to draw attention to two of them: Running a Session and Thinking Processes.

In terms of running a session, most of the time it is better not to answer the students question directly. I know this sounds kind of funny now, but stick with me. Most of the time, the best way is to actually reflect the questions back to either the student or the group they are working with. We want to ask them questions to focus their answer, but not lead them to the obvious answer - especially in comp because there are so many different solutions to the one problem. Sometimes it is better to follow them down the rabbit hole and to work out where they are heading to because 9 times out of 10 they will find their way to the answer. Of course there are the exceptions where we do have to ask leading questions and stop people going down the rabbit hole - but I think this is actually the case with design thinking too. Sometimes people just want to talk about what they want to talk about even if it clearly has nothing to do with what you are researching. As for Thinking Processes, this has more to do with the pathway mapping than the questions. I know I talked about thinking processes back in week 2, so I don't want to go into too much detail describing them. The reason I bring this up though is, in pathway mapping you outline the steps taken to get from a start point to the end point. This is the same idea on a smaller scale in thinking processes. The pain points in a thinking process could be considered the cues used to work out if a student is on track or not.

Bringing these few things together that probably seem a little unrelated, sitting in this lecture I found myself realizing that I am a design thinker already - though not with the terms that are used here. In PAL, we use a lot of design thinking to do build sessions that actually are useful rather than "should be useful". However in saying this, there are parts that should be taken away and used to improve PAL further. We need to look for the opportunity to improve more. I wonder if it would be useful to get more student quotes and to use these in the reports that are required throughout the semester. I wonder if there is a way that we could incorporate asking students for the stories used to motivate a session rather than provide stories of our own.

## What is the relationship between systems thinking an design thinking?

I think systems thinking can be considered as a subset of design thinking. To be a design thinker you need to be able to understand the system. You need to be able to break down the system and look at it as a whole from the start and end point. Where the design thinking comes in is that you need to be able to map out what is happening and work out what needs to be changed in the system when something isn't going right. Systems thinking you are looking at the system as a whole and it's interactions, but design thinking seems to take this a next step up and work out plausible solutions for the pain points in the systems interactions.

## Tutorial Facilitation

I know that we have to reflect on the tutorial but I am not 100% sure where I need to actually put the reflection of it so here seemed as good as any. I know that when we were doing the tutorial the links on the website were broken so if required I can put this up on wattle (or wherever needed) if you let me know.

I think it probably came through that of the group of people I was working with, I was the most experienced at facilitating a group. I think this actually was a huge disadvantage for me. I don't have the confidence issues of leading a group, and I have developed ways of capturing a groups attention. I feel that my team members had a bit of trouble speaking up and finding their voices in the tutorial and I feel I probably stepped in too much to help, looking back on it. They both had good stuff to say and I think I need to take away from this that I need to work more on developing ways of letting more passive people than myself lead a group. One thing I also realized is that when leading a tutorial I defaulted to floating around the groups, which is something that didn't occur to me to talk about with my team mates. It is a fairly natural thing for me because of PAL, but they didn't seem to think about it or pick it up. To be perfectly honest, what I got out of facilitating a tutorial really wasn't as much as I imagine other people have because I do it so regularly and have for a long time. For me the experience was working with people who haven't been trained to think like I do, and who don't speak up as much either. It has allowed me to identify this as something to work on, but I don't know when I will get the chance again.

# Week 5: Systems Engineering

I was a little but disappointed by this lecture as it wasn't new content, and it really wasn't very thought inspiring. Basically systems engineering in short is the practice of systems thinking. You are engineering the interactions between systems and outside interfaces. You need to know the big picture and finish projects. There was a important point brought up that a systems engineer is better represented as one person in the work force, and not three (or more) separate people. But even nowadays this seems like common knowledge (although maybe it is because this has been covered in another course already).

As a small bit of feedback for the course before answering the required question - I think the course needs to work a little more closely with COMP3120 to complement each other rather than have one course introduce some stuff one week and then have it retaught in very similar ways the week after. Granted I am a student who does look at the extra resources (and maybe this is why I am feeling this way about this weeks lecture). I honestly wish I had more to say but this week I really wasn't inspired and feel it is a waste of time to write about what I already know (and I assume the person marking this also already knows).

## Similarities and differences between software engineering and systems engineering

The big similarity about software and systems engineering is that you need to look at the big picture of things and develop requirements from this. It isn't just a little part that matters, it is the whole story. To me there seem to be two large differences between the two engineering. The first is that systems engineering seems to be more targeted towards the user than software engineering is. The user interface, for example, matters to a system engineer but not a software engineer. This leads into the second difference where the second difference that I can identify - that being that a software engineer doesn't have the ideology of having to finish a project like a systems engineer does.

# Week 6: Requirements engineering

I think one of the most important points of the topic raised in the panel was encapsulated in one of the quotes presented in the lecture:

"The hardest part of building a software system is deciding precisely what to build. No other part of the conceptual work is as difficult... . No other part of the work so cripples the resulting system if done wrong. No other part is more difficult to rectify later" -- Brooks 1995

To be honest, one of the first things that this quote made me think of was an image I have seen many times over the Internet - the legendary swing. I have no idea where it actually originated from, but I have included one of the 100 million copies around so you know what I am talking about.

Legendary Tree Swing

I think this picture really demonstrates how by not sticking to requirements and not clarifying requirements it is near impossible to deliver what was actually desired. I think this also really closely links to the first failures story where there were more change requests than actual requirements. I know I have used this video already in my COMP3100 log book, but I feel that this has the same relevancy here. It is basically a video version of the picture above. I imagine you have seen it many times now:

http://youtu.be/BKorP55Aqvg

I found it interesting how the people presenting the panel suggested that there are different roles of the client and product developers. In our COMP3100 project because we are doing an exploitative project, there isn't exactly client which means that we have had to do both sides of the coin for the requirements engineering. We have had to draft up the requirements and the non-functional and functional requirements, as well as design the architecture. I didn't realize that they were normally done by separate parties in the real world. I guess because we have been spending a lot of time going through the requirements engineering side of things in the COMP3100 project at the moment, I can really empathize with the reasons listed as to why requirements engineering is hard. We have had to deal with far too many requirements, ambiguous and incomplete rules for the competition, no stakeholder involvement, etc.. I think at times with all the stuff going on around a project it is hard to keep focus. I think the focus comes by continually revisiting the functional and non-functional requirements and by seeking answers to anything unclear. I was nice to hear how important the documentation of all the stuff mentioned above was because this is what I am working on for my project.

P.S. What the two panels were talking about in the break was so true. All the stuff we are learning about in this course, particular what not to do, we are experiencing the hard way in the projects. I completely agree with this.

# Week 7: Sustainability

I think Lorrae's part of the panel was way more useful in terms of helping me understand the role while sustainability plays in systems thinking. I really liked the links drawn between design thinking in this lecture as well. It really isn't what the products are, it is their context and environment as well. To be honest, I am not so sure how correct the idea of sustainability is though. I understand what we are defining sustainability here to be, but I don't think that is how a lot of the world sees it. I like XKCD's comic about it, shown below.

https://xkcd.com/1007/

I think there is this idea that sustainable means just the sustainability of the environment or sustainable living. Stop Global Warming and all that jazz. I think people seem to think that to be more sustainable you need to recycle more and grow your own food, or buy from the suppliers. It is one of these terms, like "Organic" that I feel might be a little too hyped up. To be honest, this is what I thought the talk was going to entail before I listened to it.

There is a game called Civilization which I enjoy playing a lot of in my spare time. In Civ IV or Civ V, every time you discover a technology a quote related to that technology appears on screen. I cant remember which particular game, but the quote that I do remember is - "Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime." I feel this quote also links to the sustainability of a system. I feel this is just as related. We all worry about how to feed people, but we don't worry about how if we feed people then it isn't very sustainable. We need to teach people how to feed themselves to make this process sustainable. This idea is related to all areas of life including small system processes like washing your clothes or mowing the lawn or even cleaning the house.

http://youtu.be/5lOSIHWOp2I

I think this youtube video above is a really good way of showing how sustainability is thought of, and how it actually fits in the world as we know it. Leyla is definitely correct in saying that good intentions can often result in far bigger problems, and that hindsight is brilliant. The thing is, people aren't thinking past the future of their generation, just how something effects them. Leyla talks about Gaia Theory (everything in nature is interconnected) which I had never head of before watching this TED talk, but it is honestly very true. I think it could even be join with Newtons third law (for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction). I really enjoyed how she talks about the system stereotype there is where a system is just a big thing, not everything in life. I think the best thing she talks about is that sustainability is built off three things: Self preservation, understanding and doing more with less. We have to have the understanding that as an individual we have the power to change the world and to make it a sustainable place. It is an opportunity try to "sustain the unsustainable". As Leyla says, "We have to see it differently. We have to think differently. And we have to seek to understand how we all make choices to make a positive outcome on the planet".

## Personal Examples I wanted to talk about

This panel reminded me a lot of my time spent traveling last year. Two examples of this idea of sustainability idea really came to mind - the first one being the Mini Plant Factory in Oxford. We went on a plant tour while here and were stepped through the process of how a mini was made from absolutely nothing to rolling out the door to the customer. When you go through the factory now, you see robotic arms everywhere. The arms are more accurate and do everything a lot quicker. Now a days in this factory, there is about 4000 humans working through the facility including all the admin work. We were told there were approximately 750 engineers actually building the cars now. In this plant's heyday there were more than 10000 people were working on building the cars alone. We were very lucky as our tour guide was a lovely gentleman who was one of those 10000 people who were building the minis before the robotics arms replaced a lot of workers. This is what really struck me though with this sustainability idea - the company could have hired anyone to be a tour guide, but instead they hired someone who use to be part of it all. They seem to show this idea that part of sustainability is reusing resources where their old purpose is no longer needed. I think this is a big part of sustainability of a system. You want to find a use for resources that are just sitting there in the background with nothing to do. It is definitely easier and cheaper to train someone up for a new role when they know how the system works compared to a completely new person.

I think the question we were asked in this lecture that was most important was - "Which technology is currently contributing MOST to sustainability?". I agree with Lorrae's response for the smart phone, but I feel for different reasons, and here is where the second part of examples from traveling. Keeping in contact with family and friends is important, especially letting them know you are alive, your location and getting news from home. Not so long ago it was all about writing letters and making those super expensive calls home for birthdays or Christmas. When traveling though I took my iPad, set up from when I used it at university the semester earlier, and used this so contact my family at home. It was instantaneous, free, and easy. I didn't have to write an email every few days - i could just text them the quick message. It was unbelievably convenient. I feel that this idea can be applied to people away from their families, international students for example. Talking to your family is now easy, cheap and convenient. I don't think this idea would have happened without smart phones. So for the different levels introduced, I think another part of level 3 is its transforming livelihoods for families separated by distance.

I think the last big impact this has had on me has been related to my COMP3100 team project. We have been meeting up with the dean and directors about the project, and every time we leave these meetings with more to do. One thing the dean said to us was that our measure of success of this project isn't if we get a robot working. It was how long the project ran strong. I didn't realize that this was a sustainability consideration. All the different things we have been asked to go away and do are things to increase the sustainability of the project. We have the idea for now, but this doesn't mean that in a few years time there will be new concepts and designs to try out. The thing we want to avoid is that the future teams don't reattempt ideas that we have already failed to implement without a new approach. And this is where the documentation and the people we are trying to involve in the project come in.

##Concluding

I guess to sum up, I really didn't think this idea was going to impact on some of the ways I perceived things. As said before, I think the word 'sustainable' is way to hyped up. In truth, this idea is actually super important, but in a sense quite explicit in the way we do things. It is there, but not in your face, in reference to systems thinking. I like that.

# Week 8: No lecture

Nothing to talk about this week.

# Week 9: Commercial Aspects of Engineering
To be honest I didn't think much of the panel this week. It was a little dry and didn't have very much I hadn't already seen or thought about. It seemed like a lot of common sense. I feel the only really big thing to take away from this lecture series is that balancing the risks surrounding a system is important to the commercial parts of the system. You have to take risks - this is a fact of life. But you need to balance the number of risks you take so that it is just enough - i.e. not too little and not too much. Maybe the best way to think about this is using the story Goldilocks and the Three Bears. When trying the first bed it is too hard, the second bed is too soft and the third bed is just right. Turns out that this is actually a thing known as the Goldilocks Principle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldilocks_principle) .

http://youtu.be/NZUVzGIZ2u8

The video above talks about the stress of employees in a workplace in terms of this Goldilocks principle. I think it quite clearly shows with the example of stress how this "just right" amount is needed. I feel that even stress can be linked back to the commercial aspects as you want your employees to get the job done, and this factors into how well things get done. Additionally as suggested above, this idea of the just right applies to everything in a systems project.

Too Many Risks Image  --  http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1985/12/26#mutable_51486

Additionally I feel this image shows pretty well the "too much" when it comes to risks. We don't know what happened to Calvin when he reached the bottom of the hill, but my guess is it was an epic crash, and maybe even a broken sled. Quite clearly though, we lost Hobbs which was never part of the plan.

Dilbert Risk Image  -- https://alignment.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/dilbert-risk-11.gif

I feel the image above sums up quite perfectly one of the biggest pit-falls when it comes to risks. Risks have to be managed, which means there needs to be someone to do it. In our COMP3100 project there is a risk and issues document which is suppose to control this. Regardless of if I think it works or not, the point is that it exists and there is someone in the project trying to minimize the risks that something will go wrong. I feel that this is the other important part to what this lecture might have been showing us. There needs to be someone watching out and attempting to minimize anything that has a negative impact on the commercial aspects of the system.

# Week 10: Model-Based Systems Engineering
I think this was one of those lectures that had so much potential and was really disappointing. I feel that this lecture was actually meant to teach us about how we can use modeling and architecture to design a system, and the way that the system starts from a single idea or concept and grows into the complex challenge we have to build and maintain. I think it should have additionally been teaching us why using models to represent the system are important and how they can be useful. And I honestly feel that this lecture failed in doing so. I believe that the video below starting at 11:15 was way more useful in understanding model-based systems engineering.

http://youtu.be/pToqX1HH-R8

Clive talked about multiple different ways to communicate a software system and how some are more hard to understand than others when you come from a non-software based background. As an amateur systems architect I think that this might have something to do with the reluctance to look at the adoption of MDD as an industry standard. It is human nature to avoid things that scare us, and one of the most common things that scares us is a lack of understanding. I think that the Dilbert image below quite clearly shows this. I think one of the biggest fears is that there are many different ways to describe a system - and there are many models required to design a system adequately. The thing is, the model of the system is so important because it IS the design of the system. It contains all the ins and outs of the system and how it all works together.

Dilbert, Too Many Requirements  --  https://pointlessdiagrams.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/dilbert.jpg

In my COMP3100 project I have already had to deal with a lot of architectural decisions, and this was one of the things that I had to clarify with my mentor a few weeks ago. There was a question about how user stories related to MDD and I am not sure if it was a lack of timing but I don't think the relationship was clearly enough explained. Clive seemed to suggest that user stories or use cases are a potential way of starting but are not always necessary. I actually feel that this cant be true. I think that you need to be able to define the capabilities of a system before you can design and build a system. Additionally, with systems so complex now-a-days I feel that it is basically a requirement of EVERY system to seek out the capabilities of the system so that you can start identifying the relationships within the system. And speaking from experience, there are often many hidden relationships at first which take a while to identify (possibly less with more experts having influence over the system). The other thing that I have learnt from working on the architecture of this system is that things never stay simple for long. What you believe to be a simple element is never as simple as you think. And what this really means that the model of the system is continually growing and developing as the system does the same.

The model of a system is so important because of the story it tells. The system should be a direct derivation of the model, and the model should be correct for the system. Because of this I think the idea of model compilers is really really cool. I think it could be absolutely amazing if we could take the models of the system from a really high level and make it into code. I think it could be even cooler if we could take a software engineering project and have the ability to make it into the models of the system so far. I think there is potentially many systems with similar (if not the same) designs that could reuse the majority of the same model. This idea could easily reduce the complexity, the cost and and the failures of a system. I particularly like the idea of reducing failures because you can use a system model which is known to work as a starting place and go from there. The other really cool thing about this idea of model to code to model is that it removes a lot of human error when they are translated between the two. There is no longer the possibility to miss or forget parts of the model which contains the system design.

# Week 11: Human Aspects of Complex Systems
I really liked how this panel was presented and how the idea was presented through a easy to follow example. What really stuck was how human errors stack up so easily, as shown by the Swiss cheese model. Something bad can happen, often because many active failures or errors pile up with unlucky conditions. I believe this would happen a lot with teams that don't function as well as they should, where communication breaks down. This seems a lot like domino theory - the dominoes keep pushing the next one over unless someone intervenes.

Image, Human 2

I feel of all the images we were shown in the panel, these two were the ones that stood out as the most important. The left hand image shows how deal with problems in a continuous cycle, while the right hand image shows how different risks have different severity values. I think between the combination of these a message can be drawn - that every time an failure has gone through the cycle to address it, both this error, and the rest of the errors in the system change in severity on this tabular scale.

Richard Cook talks in the video below about "How Complex Systems Fail" - or as he puts it "How Complex Systems Don't Fail". I feel that he makes some really great points in the video and it is worth the time. I think the best point he makes is how there is a difference between a reliable system during the design phase, and a resilient system when it is implemented. A system has to be able to reliable work when you are in the design and build stages. You want it to meet all requirements of the system which were given. However regardless of the reliability of the system - if the system can not meet the requirements of all its users for the life of the system then it fails to be resilient. He likes to use the health care system which makes a great example. He talks about how a hospital brought all state of the art new equipment and a year later roughly 50% of the new equipment stopped working a year in. It majorly effected the way the hospital system ran. But the thing is, it was what cased the equipment to stop working that was the failure. In short, the equipment needed a software update, and a date of one year after it was brought was set. The design of the equipment ensured that if the software hadn't been updated when this time period rolled over then the equipment couldn't be used. There weren't notifications. The hospital staff weren't aware of it. But it was set by the people who installed the new equipment. There was a breakdown in human communication which caused a system failure. The Swiss cheese model definitely can be applied to this.

## Tell us about a situation when human aspects have had a significant impact on a project you have been involved with.

When I first looked at this problem I had a lot of difficulty coming up with any answers, and I believe this is because I was trying to come up with something big - something that was actually a problem that caused failure. The thing is, every system, big or small, has different levels of failure. Upon realizing this I got a little further in answering this question. I think the easiest system for me to talk about would be the PAL sessions that I am required to run. Every week different session are run around different topics and every session is run on white-boards in groups. We do not use laptops even though we run comp-sci PAL. The long and short though was that this year our system broke in week 6, where the sessions that we planned didn't actually run because students used their laptops and were in their own little bubble the entire session. Hindsight - the wonderful thing - lets me look back on this and notice that there were a few key errors we made in the lead up to this. We didn't stop then explicitly enough to maintain control of the situation. We said we would help, just not explicitly at the end of the session. Additionally in the lead up to the study event which PAL helped run, we were allowing limited laptop use. There was also the 'unfortunate situations' which effected this such as the stress of the students to complete the assignment. Basically we had a small scale example of the Swiss cheese model that we had to deal with in term 2 this year.

# Week 12: Expert Panel - The Big picture
Personally, I feel it is a little hard to quantify how much I got out of this course. I feel that for the most part, this course cemented what I already knew, applied a name and gave me a reason to look into it further. I think even though I feel that I knew a lot of this, I was still holding perceptions about software engineering that really shouldn't have been there. For instance, I thought walking into this course that software engineering was the way that a product for a company was built - that this was the start and end point for a system. Even though I was already asking the systems engineering questions, I didn't view it as a different piece to a big puzzle. I now understand that systems engineering is made up of software engineering amongst other parts, and it is the systems engineering that brings everything together to make it work. I feel here is a great transition to this video...

I feel this video sums up the course fairly perfectly. Systems engineering isn't just a process, it isn't just a major for your degree, it isn't a way to bludge your way through the work force. Systems engineering is about providing the big picture with regards to things like people, the process, the product - i.e. The System which is doing the requirements. It is about knowing how everything works - and interacts - together. Most importantly, it is about managing change - change of the system and of the requirements. I think on of the most significant things summarized though is it is about linking the different parts of the system requirements to tests and models, and this should be done by what makes logical sense rather than the same folder.

The work force is all about working with a team of experts in their field. It is a complex multidisciplinary environment with everyone having different aims and requirements, all which fit into the same system. Part of being a systems engineer - a systems thinker - is to have some knowledge in each of these systems so that you can bring such teams of experts together. Success does emerge from such environments. I think one of the reasons that makes this type of environment so successful is because by using system thinking there is a better chance of understanding problems from many perspectives before any particular software/systems solution is put in place. When building a system, working with a team of experts in different areas does require strong communication skills. It is near impossible to describe something in computing terms to people who do not share the same background as you. Something every system engineer needs to master is the ability to communicate a part of the system which is unknown to the expert, in terms the expert can understand.

XKCD, Ten Thousand   https://xkcd.com/1053/

I think the last big point that was really emphasized in this course was that failure of a system does happen. It can be for many reason, but generally it is always because of the human factor. This could be as simple as we overlook part of a system, or we don't understand or know what is happening. It could be as complex as conflicting interests, goals and/or expectations out of the end result of the system. It is something that as systems engineers we have to be aware of and control where possible. I think the comic up above from XKCD summarizes this beautifully.

It was said to me earlier this week that without a basic knowledge of everything about the system, it is potentially impossible to be a systems engineer. In not so many words, I agree with this. Systems are a complex thing with many inter- and intra- connected elements. I feel that as a systems engineer you do have to know all these elements at a base level. You need to be able to know what they do and roughly how they do it. For me, being the systems architect on my COMP3100 project has allowed me to see how important this is. When making some design decisions, I have to be able to follow what the experts are saying before I can work what they are saying into the design. Basically - the last thing I really want to emphasize is how important understanding all parts of the system is, even if it is a conceptual understanding, when looking, building, evaluating, analyzing, designing or participating in part of a system. I guess this summarizes my take-away message from this course - Systems Engineering is what bring the software projects together and actually makes it something. Without the system, it is just a bit of software that potentially does absolutely nothing.
